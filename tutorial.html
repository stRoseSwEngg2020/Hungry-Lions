</center>
<p>-You are an explorer trying to find long lost treasure underground.</p>
<p>-You must traverse a 2-D grid until you find the treasure or run out of health points.</p>
<p>-":)" marks where you are currently standing on the grid.</p>
<p>-"?" represents unexplored territory. You might find the treasure...or trigger a mine instead! You will lose HP if you land on a mine.</p>
<p>-"X" spaces mark the spaces you already checked.</p>
<p>-"[ ]" represents an empty space. These spaces hold neither treasure nor trap, but they lower the number of spaces you must check in each level.</p>
<p>-[$] the treasure is hidden in a random "?" space. Find it in three levels in a row to win!</p>
<p>-Click a box on the grid to guess where the treasure is hidden.</p>
<p>-Click 'Quit Game' to stop playing and return to the menu.</p>
